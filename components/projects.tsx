        'Developed complete wireless charging solution harnessing solar energy',
        'Designed power management circuitry for efficient energy conversion',
        'Implemented resonant inductive coupling for wireless power transfer',
        'Optimized system for maximum energy efficiency and charge stability'

        'Solar panel integration with varying light conditions',
        'Precision tuning of resonant circuits',
        'Thermal management during charging cycles',
        'Maintaining consistent power delivery'
      ],
      detailedDescription: `During my bachelors at Girne American University, one of my key projects involved the development of a wireless mobile charging system powered by solar energy. This project allowed me to synthesize my accumulated knowledge of electronics. Given my strong foundation in electronic circuitry, the design and implementation of the core charging mechanism itself presented a manageable challenge. However, the project's true complexity lay in the iterative process of achieving each milestone. While the underlying concepts were not inherently difficult, the practical realization of a functional and efficient system demanded significant time and meticulous attention to detail. Every stage, from solar panel integration to wireless power transfer optimization, presented unique hurdles that required creative problem-solving and rigorous testing.`,

      title: 'Wireless Battery Charging System with Battery Monitoring',
      institution: 'Girne American University',
      period: 'Semester Project',
      description: [
        'Implemented wireless charging using transmitter/receiver coils',
        'Arduino-controlled charging with LCD battery display',
        'Designed battery voltage/current monitoring circuit',
        'Extensive research and circuit design implementation'
      ],
      challenges: [
        'Complex code implementation and debugging',
        'Fine-tuning charging current and system parameters',
        'Ensuring stable wireless power transfer',
        'Achieving real-time battery monitoring accuracy'
      ],
      detailedDescription: `I developed a wireless battery charging system that displays the battery percentage and strength using an Arduino. Although this code was not simple, I dedicated many hours to research and circuit design to complete the project. The system uses a transmitter coil to generate an electromagnetic field that induces current in a receiver coil, which then charges the battery. The Arduino controls the charging process while monitoring the battery's state of charge, displaying voltage, current, and charge percentage on an LCD screen. This challenging but rewarding experience deepened my understanding of both electronics and programming, and I'm grateful to my professor Dr. Kamil Dimililer for his guidance.`,
